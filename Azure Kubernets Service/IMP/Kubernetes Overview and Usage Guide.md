# Kubernetes Overview and Usage Guide

## What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications. It provides a framework to run distributed systems resiliently.

## Components of Kubernetes

### Pods
Basic scheduling unit that holds one or more containers.

### Nodes
Machines (physical or virtual) in the cluster where pods are scheduled.

### Cluster
Collection of nodes and associated resources.

### Kubelet
An agent running on each node, responsible for managing the node and its containers.

### Kubernetes Controller Manager
Manages controllers to regulate the state of the system.

### Kube Proxy
Maintains network rules to allow communication between pods and external traffic.

### etcd
Consistent and highly-available key-value store used for all cluster data.

### API Server
Serves the Kubernetes API and is the primary entry point for administrative tasks.

### Scheduler
Assigns pods to nodes based on resource requirements and other constraints.

### Controller
Maintains the desired state of the system, such as ensuring the correct number of replicas for a particular application.

### Service
Provides a consistent way to access a set of pods.

### Namespace
A way to divide cluster resources between multiple users.

### Volumes
Kubernetes supports various types of storage volumes, providing data persistence for pods.

### Secrets and ConfigMaps
Mechanisms to manage sensitive information and configuration data separately from application code.

### Deployment
A higher-level resource that manages updates to applications by handling the deployment and scaling of pods.

### StatefulSets
Manages stateful applications, ensuring stable network identities and persistent storage for pods.

### DaemonSets
Ensures that specific pods run on all (or specific) nodes for cluster-wide tasks like logging or monitoring.

### Jobs and CronJobs
Run short-lived or scheduled tasks within the cluster.

### Ingress
Manages external access to services, typically HTTP.

### Network Policies
Define how groups of pods can communicate with each other and other network endpoints.

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
Automatically adjusts the number of replica pods to handle varying load.

### Vertical Pod Autoscaler
Adjusts the resources allocated to individual pods based on their usage.

### Operators
A way to package, deploy, and manage applications using Kubernetes APIs and controllers.

### Kubectl
The command-line interface to interact with Kubernetes clusters.
