# Example Workflow: Setting up Azure DevOps Connections to Azure Resources

Hereâ€™s a typical workflow to set up Azure DevOps connections to Azure resources:

1. **Create Azure Subscription:**
   - If not already created, set up an Azure subscription.

2. **Create Azure DevOps Organization:**
   - Create an Azure DevOps organization if you haven't already.

3. **Set Up Azure Active Directory:**
   - Create a service principal or managed identity in Azure AD based on your authentication method preference.

4. **Create Azure Resources:**
   - Depending on your application requirements, create necessary Azure resources like Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database, ACR, etc., in appropriate resource groups.

5. **Configure Service Connections:**
   - In Azure DevOps, navigate to Project Settings > Service connections.
   - Create new service connections for each Azure resource you want to integrate with your CI/CD pipelines.
   - Choose the appropriate authentication method (service principal, managed identity, OAuth token) and provide necessary credentials or tokens.

6. **Configure Pipelines:**
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps to build, test, and deploy applications using the configured service connections.
   - Use these pipelines to automate deployments to Azure resources like Azure App Service, ACR, etc.
